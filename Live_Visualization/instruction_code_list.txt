List of Codes to pass from biodata_spacebrew_client.py to biodata_visualization.html 


Channel: instruction

All codes are passed as JSON via the Spacebrew channel "instruction". 
All the json objects have a key "instruction_name", which is the name of the instruction. Possible values are:

DISPLAY_INSTRUCTION
BASELINE_COLLECTION
CONDITION_COLLECTION
POST_EXPERIMENT
CONNECTED
DISCONNECTED

The other keys differ by instruction. They are listed for each possible value, along with the meaning of the instruction. 

DISPLAY_INSTRUCTION -> show a screen with a central label matching the content sent in the instruction (note: this includes all confirmation screens, querying the user screens, and NO_EXPERIMENT condition)
additional parameters:
	instruction_text: The string to be passed in. This will be html? 

BASELINE_COLLECTION -> Display live updating graph of EEG & ECG values, and a timer to countdown the trial. 
additional parameters: 
	display_seconds: the amount of time the baseline collection will go on for. This is for displaying our timer. 

CONDITION_COLLECTION -> Display live updating graph of EEG & ECG values, and a concentric pulse circle to synchronize breath to. 
additional parameters: 
	display_seconds: the amount of time the condition collection will go on for. This is for displaying our timer. 
	condition: the name of the condition to display. Defaults to controlled breathing condition. 
	baseline_alpha: the average value of alpha waves during baseline, to plot on graph
	baseline_hrv: the average value of hrv during baseline, to plot on graph

POST_EXPERIMENT -> show screen with bar charts & description of changes that happened to user
additional parameters: 
	baseline_alpha: the average value of alpha waves during baseline, to plot on graph
	baseline_hrv: the average value of hrv during baseline, to plot on graph
	baseline_subj: user post-baseline answers, comma-delimited string of 4 values: calm, content, distracted, tbd 
	condition_alpha: the average value of alpha waves during condition, to plot on graph
	condition_hrv: the average value of hrv during condition, to plot on graph
	condition_subj: user post-condition answers, comma-delimited string of 4 values: calm, content, distracted, tbd
	interpretation_text: Text used to help user interpret final results
	new_user_text: Text used to orient a new user who is considering using our station

CONNECTED -> either the eeg or the ecg has started sending data. Update the eeg_connected or ecg_connected label. 
additional_parameters: 
	type: either "eeg" or "ecg"

DISCONNECTED -> either the eeg or the ecg has stopped sending data. Update the eeg_connected or ecg_connected label. 
additional_parameters: 
	type: either "eeg" or "ecg"	

Channel: eeg_ecg
	keys
	timestamp : timestamp of eeg and ecg value to plot
	eeg: alpha_absolute averaged over 2 sensors
	ecg: raw ecg or hrv (depending on type of graph?)
